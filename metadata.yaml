description: "Montezuma's Daughter, first published in 1893, is a novel written by\
  \ the Victorian adventure writer H. Rider Haggard. Narrated in the first person\
  \ by Thomas Wingfield, an Englishman whose adventures include having his mother\
  \ murdered, a brush with the Spanish Inquisition, shipwreck, and slavery. Eventually,\
  \ Thomas unwillingly joins a Spanish expedition to New Spain, and the novel tells\
  \ the fictionalized story of the first interactions between the natives and European\
  \ explorers. This includes a number of misunderstandings, prejudice on the part\
  \ of the Spaniards, and ultimately open war.\nDuring the course of the story, Thomas\
  \ meets and marries the daughter of the native king (from whom the novel takes its\
  \ title) and settles into life in Mexico. The war destroys his native family, and\
  \ eventually Thomas gets revenge on the antagonist and returns to England.\nWhile\
  \ in Mexico in 1891 researching for the book Haggard received news that his only\
  \ son had died, which dealt him a lasting blow and badly affected his health. Haggard\
  \ himself recognised that Montezuma's Daughter was the last of his best work \"\
  for the rest was repetition so far as fiction was concerned\". Like many Victorian\
  \ adventure novels, this one sometimes treats the natives as na√Øve and barbaric,\
  \ a flaw Haggard explicitly points out in his main character.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
